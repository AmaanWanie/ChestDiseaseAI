#COVID-19 Detection

Model: ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Purpose: Accurately classifies chest X-ray images into three categories: normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19.

Methodology: The model leverages deep learning techniques to extract relevant features from chest X-ray images and classify them into respective categories.
            trained on ~42.3k images.
